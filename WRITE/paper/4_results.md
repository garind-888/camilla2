## Results

Between January 2018 and December 2024, a total of 59 consecutive patients with 66 de novo coronary lesions treated with DCB angioplasty were included in this analysis. The mean patient age was 70.1±8.2 years, and 13 patients (22.0%) were female, hypertension present in 36 patients (61.0%), diabetes mellitus in 22 (37.3%). Most patients had undergone previous percutaneous coronary intervention (45 patients, 76.3%). The primary clinical indication for intervention was chronic coronary syndrome in 52 patients (88.1%). The treated lesions had a median reference vessel diameter of 2.5 [1.8-2.8] mm. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery was the most frequently treated vessel (38 lesions, 64.4%). Complex lesion morphology was common, with bifurcation involvement in 21 lesions (35.6%), chronic total occlusions in 15 lesions (25.4%). Lesion preparation was performed in 52 cases (88.1%), utilizing cutting balloons in 17 cases (28.8%), scoring balloons in 2 cases (3.4%), and intravascular lithotripsy in 3 cases (5.1%). Paclitaxel-coated balloons were used in 44 procedures (77.2%) with the rest sirolimus-coated balloons.

At a mean follow-up of 8.5±5.1 months, target vessel failure occurred in 8 lesions (12.1%) and target lesion failure in 14 lesions (21.2%). Among the 5 lesions with available follow-up angiography showing stenosis, all demonstrated residual stenosis requiring intervention. The median follow-up minimal lumen diameter for all lesions was 1.7 [1.3-2.0] mm compared to 1.7 [1.4-1.9] mm immediately post-procedure, while the subset without target lesion failure showed improvement to 1.8 [1.5-2.0] mm from 1.7 [1.4-2.0] mm post-procedure.

Paired analysis of temporal changes revealed heterogeneous patterns of late lumen evolution. Among the 66 lesions with complete angiographic follow-up data, the mean minimal lumen diameter change from post-procedure to follow-up was -0.04±0.50 mm (95% CI -0.16 to 0.09; p=0.62), with 36 lesions (54.5%) demonstrating late lumen gain and 29 lesions (43.9%) showing late lumen loss. When excluding lesions with target lesion failure from the analysis, a significant late lumen gain of 0.10±0.30 mm was observed (95% CI 0.01 to 0.18; p=0.03), with 42 lesions (63.6%) showing gain versus 23 lesions (34.8%) with loss. The microvascular fractional flow reserve demonstrated significant improvement from 87.5±9.1% post-procedure to 89.8±7.0% at follow-up (mean change 2.3%; 95% CI -0.08 to 4.68; p=0.006), with 30 lesions (60.0%) showing functional gain. When including re-intervention procedures, the functional improvement was more pronounced at 3.8% (95% CI 1.46 to 6.15; p<0.001), with 42 lesions (63.6%) demonstrating physiological gain.

Predictors of late functional gain were evaluated through comprehensive univariate and multivariate analyses. In univariate analysis of continuous μFR change, DCB inflation time demonstrated a significant positive association with functional improvement (coefficient 0.41; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.71; p=0.011), suggesting that each additional second of inflation was associated with a 0.41% increase in μFR. Similarly, the DCB diameter-to-vessel ratio showed significant correlation with functional gain (coefficient 12.68; 95% CI 2.58 to 22.79; p=0.015), while the predilatation balloon diameter-to-vessel ratio demonstrated borderline significance (coefficient 8.17; 95% CI -0.45 to 16.79; p=0.063). When analyzing functional gain as a binary outcome, the predilatation diameter-to-vessel ratio emerged as the strongest predictor (OR 17.23; 95% CI 0.68 to 130.14; p=0.006), followed by the DCB diameter-to-vessel ratio (OR 14.38; 95% CI 0.93 to 111.87; p=0.011). Prior coronary artery bypass grafting showed a trend toward reduced functional gain (coefficient -14.86; 95% CI -32.72 to 3.00; p=0.10). In multivariate analysis adjusting for confounding variables, the DCB inflation time retained borderline significance for continuous functional change (coefficient 0.35; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.71; p=0.059), while the predilatation diameter-to-vessel ratio maintained a trend toward predicting binary functional gain (OR 12.38; 95% CI 0.65 to 237.15; p=0.095). Notably, clinical characteristics including age, diabetes status, hypertension, left ventricular ejection fraction, and estimated glomerular filtration rate did not demonstrate significant associations with late functional gain in either univariate or multivariate models. Lesion characteristics such as chronic total occlusion, ostial location, and calcification severity similarly showed no predictive value for functional improvement (all p>0.20).

Analysis of predictors for late lumen enlargement measured by minimal lumen diameter revealed distinct procedural and clinical factors influencing anatomical outcomes. DCB inflation time emerged as the most consistent predictor across analyses, with each additional second of inflation associated with a 0.011 mm increase in late lumen diameter change (95% CI 0.002 to 0.019; p=0.015) in univariate analysis, maintaining borderline significance in multivariate adjustment (coefficient 0.012; 95% CI -0.00003 to 0.023; p=0.050). When examining lumen gain as a binary outcome, DCB inflation time demonstrated increased odds of achieving lumen gain (OR 1.32; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.78; p=0.069), while the use of paclitaxel versus other drug types showed a trend toward reduced likelihood of lumen gain (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.04 to 1.10; p=0.065). Patient age exhibited borderline association with lumen gain probability (OR 1.06 per year; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.14; p=0.067), and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate showed a similar trend (OR 0.95 per mL/min/1.73m²; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.01; p=0.081). The DCB diameter-to-vessel ratio, while not reaching statistical significance for continuous lumen change (coefficient 0.18; 95% CI -0.15 to 0.51; p=0.28), demonstrated a trend toward predicting binary lumen gain (OR 4.46; 95% CI 0.79 to 26.32; p=0.099). Prior coronary artery bypass grafting showed a numerically large but statistically non-significant association with reduced late lumen diameter (coefficient -0.44; 95% CI -1.00 to 0.12; p=0.124). Notably, traditional cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prior myocardial infarction showed no association with late lumen changes (all p>0.40), nor did anatomical characteristics such as chronic total occlusion status, ostial lesion location, or degree of calcification influence late lumen evolution (all p>0.20).

Analysis of secondary endpoints revealed important associations with procedural and patient characteristics that provide mechanistic insights into DCB performance. Late recoil, defined as the difference between maximal balloon diameter and follow-up minimal lumen diameter, was strongly influenced by balloon sizing strategy, with the DCB diameter-to-vessel ratio showing the strongest association (coefficient 0.72; 95% CI 0.31 to 1.13; p<0.001), followed by the predilatation balloon diameter-to-vessel ratio (coefficient 0.52; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.87; p=0.004). Female sex was associated with reduced late recoil (coefficient -0.42; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.10; p=0.010), suggesting potential sex-based differences in vessel remodeling response. Net gain in minimal lumen diameter, representing the overall anatomical benefit from baseline to follow-up, demonstrated the strongest association with DCB inflation time among all analyzed outcomes (coefficient 0.037 mm per second; 95% CI 0.025 to 0.050; p<0.001), emphasizing the critical importance of adequate drug delivery duration. Net functional gain measured by microvascular fractional flow reserve similarly showed positive association with inflation time (coefficient 1.16% per second; 95% CI 0.21 to 2.11; p=0.017), while diabetes mellitus emerged as a significant negative predictor of net functional improvement (coefficient -40.87%; 95% CI -80.52 to -1.21; p=0.045), suggesting impaired physiological response to DCB therapy in diabetic patients. These findings collectively highlight that procedural technique, particularly balloon sizing strategy and inflation duration, plays a more decisive role in determining both anatomical and functional outcomes than baseline clinical characteristics, with the notable exception of diabetes affecting physiological recovery.
