Dear {editor} and Editorial Team,

Please find enclosed our manuscript, "{title}" submitted for your consideration for publication in {journal}. This research letter presents the first documentation of late functional gain in patients undergoing drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty for de novo coronary disease.

While late lumen enlargement after DCB has been well-established anatomically, the temporal evolution of coronary physiology remained unclear. Our analysis of 132 angiographies from 66 consecutive lesions in the CARDIO-FR registry reveals that Murray law-based quantitative flow ratio (μQFR) significantly improves from 87.5% immediately post-procedure to 89.8% at follow-up (p=0.006), with 60% of lesions demonstrating functional gain. This finding fundamentally distinguishes DCB from drug-eluting stents, where FFR typically deteriorates over time, and plain balloon angioplasty, where restenosis causes functional decline. Importantly, we identified modifiable procedural determinants of this phenomenon: DCB inflation time (+0.41% μQFR per second, p=0.011) and balloon-to-vessel sizing ratios, with optimization analysis suggesting an ideal DCB-to-artery ratio of 1.31 for maximizing functional gain.

These findings have profound implications for understanding DCB biology and optimizing procedural techniques. They provide mechanistic insights into sustained biological vessel healing without permanent implants. The documentation of progressive physiological improvement supports DCB as a truly restorative intervention, particularly valuable for younger patients, vessels requiring preservation for future surgical options, and cases where maintaining native coronary physiology is paramount. We believe this manuscript would be of significant interest to {journal}'s readership, particularly given the journal's focus on innovative coronary interventions and commitment to advancing evidence-based practice in the rapidly evolving field of DCB therapy.

We hereby declare that this paper is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. None of the paper's contents have been previously published in any form. All authors have thoroughly read and approved the final version of the manuscript. The authors declare no conflicts of interest related to this work.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your editorial review.

Sincerely,
