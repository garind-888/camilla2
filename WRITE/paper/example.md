# ABSTRACT

**Background**: Drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty has emerged as a stentless alternative for de novo coronary artery disease. However, the prognostic value of post-procedural angiography-derived physiology, particularly three-dimensional (3D) Murray-law quantitative flow ratio (μQFR), after DCB in native vessels remains unclear.

**Objectives**: To quantify the prognostic value of immediate post-DCB 3D-μQFR for predicting lesion failure in de novo coronary disease.

**Methods**: We conducted an analysis of the prospective CARDIO-FR registry, including all patients undergoing DCB angioplasty for de novo coronary lesions between January 2018 and December 2024. 3D-μQFR and quantitative coronary angiography were performed offline by independent analysts. The primary endpoint was the vessel-oriented composite endpoint (VOCE: cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or target-vessel revascularization).

**Results**: Among 81 patients (87 lesions), VOCE occurred in 33 lesions during median follow-up of 240 days. Post-procedural 3D-μQFR was significantly lower in VOCE lesions (median 76.5 vs. 90.0, p<0.001). ROC analysis identified optimal μQFR threshold of 0.83 (AUC 0.74). In multivariate and propensity-matched analyses, μQFR <0.83 was independently associated with higher VOCE rates (HR 6.01, 95% CI 2.48–14.46, p<0.0001).

**Conclusions**: Immediate post-DCB 3D-μQFR independently predicts adverse vessel outcomes in de novo coronary disease. Physiology-guided optimization of DCB angioplasty may improve long-term results and warrants prospective validation.

# INTRODUCTION

## Background

Drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty is increasingly used for coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) and de novo disease, offering a "leave-nothing-behind" alternative to conventional drug-eluting stents (DES) [@fezziDefinitionsStandardizedEndpoints2025; @spauldingComparingStrategySirolimuseluting2023]. Suboptimal post-DES physiological results assessed by fractional flow reserve (FFR) have been associated with adverse long-term outcomes [@debruyneFractionalFlowReserve2012; @baranauskasFFRResultPost2016]. Various less invasive methodologies, such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR), have been proposed as physiological targets to guide percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with DES [@fearonAccuracyFractionalFlow2019; @witbergDiagnosticPerformanceAngiogramDerived2020]. 

However, the capacity of DCB-based strategies to effectively resolve flow-limiting ischemia both acutely and at follow-up remains understudied and could help better identify undertreated lesions more effectively [@chungComparisonFractionalFlow2019]. A final Murray law-based QFR (μQFR) <0.86 after DCB for ISR has been associated with a rise in adverse events [@tangClinicalImplicationQuantitative2021]. Recent insights from the PICCOLETO VI trial, comparing different DCB technologies, reported post-procedural μQFR values (0.86-0.87) with minimal late functional loss at 6 months [@piccoletoVI]. However, no published study has looked at hard endpoint and established prognostic μQFR thresholds after DCB for native vessels.

Therefore, our primary objective is to quantify the prognostic value of immediate post-DCB 3D-μQFR for vessel and lesion failure in de novo coronary disease in an all-comers population. We hypothesize that a lower 3D-μQFR threshold will identify lesions prone to recurrence, mirroring the previously noted ISR experience. Establishing this relationship could provide a physiology-guided framework for optimizing stentless therapy in native vessels and inform future prospective trials focused on DCB-based strategies.

# METHODS

## Study design

This was a retrospective analysis of data from the ongoing, prospective CARDIO-FR registry, a single-centre cohort initiated in January 2015 at the University and Hospital of Fribourg, Switzerland. The registry prospectively enrols consecutive patients who undergo coronary angioplasty with DES, starting from January 2015, and those treated with DCB since January 2018. Follow-up (3 months, 1, 2, 5 and 10 years) was obtained by clinic visit or telephone; two blinded interventional cardiologists adjudicated events. For this study, we selected every patient who received DCB for de novo coronary disease between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2024. Patients were excluded if the treated lesion was due to ISR, if angiographic recordings were considered inadequate for accurate post-procedural 3D-µQFR analysis, or if clinical follow-up data were unavailable. The CARDIO-FR registry(NCT04185285) is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, has received approval from the local ethics committee (003-REP-CER-FR), and written informed consent was obtained from every participant prior to enrolment.

## Study endpoints and definitions

The primary endpoint, VOCE, was defined as cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction (TVMI), or clinically driven target-vessel revascularisation (TVR). Secondary endpoints included the individual components of VOCE and target-lesion revascularisation (TLR). The definitions of TLR, TVR, and TVMI followed the Drug-Coated Balloon Academic Research Consortium criteria [@fezziDefinitionsStandardizedEndpoints2025]. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) provided measurements of reference vessel diameter, minimal lumen diameter/area (MLD/MLA), and lesion length. A detailed definition of the endpoints and measurements is available in Supplementary Table S1.

## Study procedure

### Coronary angiography

Angiographic images were recorded at a minimum of 12.5 frames per second with a monoplane radiographic system (Azurion 3, Philips Healthcare, NL). Videos in which angiographic images acquisition has been realized to minimize vessel overlap and foreshortening were selected for 3D-µQFR assessment. The contrast medium was injected manually with a forceful and stable injection with ACIST CVi contrast injector (Bracco, I).

### Quantitative coronary angiography and 3D-µQFR analysis

Offline 3D-QCA and 3D-μQFR assessments were performed with Angioplus Galley (Pulse Medical Imaging Technology, Shanghai, China) by two independent analysts who were blinded, mutually independent, and experienced in physiology‐derived imaging. 
All angiograms were anonymised and randomised before review. 
For each lesion the analysts first selected the projection that optimally visualised the vessel from ostium to distal segment, minimising overlap and foreshortening. 
Operators were instructed to modify manual analysis as little as possible, with lumen contours refined only when automated delineation proved inadequate.
A second projection ≥25° apart of diagnostic quality were selected to generate a full 3D-QCA reconstruction, and the corresponding 3D-μQFR was calculated. 
The frame with the clearest anatomic definition of the lesion served as the reference for velocity computation and Murray law–based diameter scaling, which applies stepwise calibre changes at bifurcations. 
If there was a significant jump in the vessel flow, the fixed flow proposed by the software was used.
The software then automatically derived flow velocity profiles and calculated physiologic indices for the main vessel and any relevant side branches. Two 3D-µQFR analysis are shown in Figure 2.

## Statistical analysis

Continuous data are mean ± SD or median (IQR) and compared with t-test or Mann-Whitney U; categorical data are n (%) and compared with χ²/Fisher's exact. ROC analysis identified the μQFR cut-off value for predicting VOCE, as determined by the Youden index. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was conducted, comparing groups defined by the μQFR cut-off using the log-rank test. Uni- and multi-variate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of VOCE. Proportional hazards assumptions were assessed using Schoenfeld residual tests. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Lesions were then classified as low (<optimal cutoff) or high (≥optimal cutoff) µQFR. Propensity scores were calculated using logistic regression with clinical and anatomical variables. Lesions were matched 2:1 without replacement, using a 0.20 calliper. Covariate balance was assessed by standardized mean differences (SMD). HR were estimated with stratified Cox models and robust variance. AUCs of predictors were compared using Hanley–McNeil's paired z-test. A two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were conducted with Python 3.13.0 (NumPy, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, lifelines, SciPy) in Visual Studio Code (version 1.95, © Microsoft 2025) connected to a local PostgreSQL database (version 14.15) administered via DBeaver (version 24.3.4, © DBeaver Corp 2025).

# Results

Between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2024, 4,725 patients were included in the CARDIO-FR registry, of whom 120 were treated with DCB-only PCI. Thirty-nine patients were then excluded (34 for ISR, 3 for inadequate post-procedural imaging, and 2 due to loss of follow-up). The remaining 81 patients, with 87 DCB-treated de novo lesions, were eligible for analysis. A second angiographic view allowing to build a 3D-μQFR was obtained for 74 (85.1%) of the cases. The median follow-up time was 240 [125–462] days. The median patient age was 64 years [58.5–75.0], 79.5% were male, the body-mass index (BMI) was 27.9 ± 4.5 kg/m², 67% had prior revascularization and diabetes was present in 42%. The primary clinical indication was chronic coronary syndrome (63.6%), followed by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (22.7%), unstable angina (4.5%), and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (3.4%) (Table 1). Reference vessel diameter was 3.30 [2.75-3.75] mm with largest DCB 2.50 [2.0-2.88] mm, lesion size was 24 [18.5-30.0] mm. The median post-DCB µQFR was 0.86 [0.78–0.92].

 During follow-up, VOCE occurred in 33 lesions, with 7 clinically driven TVRs (including 2 TVMIs); the rest were clinically driven TLRs. Baseline characteristics were similar but procedural characteristics differed significantly between VOCE and non-VOCE groups. VOCE lesions more often involved the LAD (85.3% vs. 51.9%, p<0.001), while the LCx was more common in non-VOCE cases (37.0% vs. 5.9%, p=0.001). Bifurcation lesions were also more frequent in VOCE cases (47.1% vs. 20.4%, p=0.016). Post-procedural angiography showed smaller MLD, MLA, acute MLA gain and acute lumen gain (all p < 0.03) in VOCE lesions. While baseline µQFR was similar, post-DCB μQFR was significantly lower in VOCE lesions (76.5% vs. 90.0%; p < 0.001) as well as acute physiological gain (p=0.004) (Table 2).

ROC analysis identified an optimal μQFR threshold of 0.83 to discriminate VOCE risk, with an AUC of 0.74, sensitivity 68% and specificity 75% (Figure 3A) . The corresponding spline-modelled hazard function is displayed in Figure 3B & Supplementary Figure 1. Table 3 shows the lesion-level cluster-robust Cox regression analyses for the μQFR as well as stratification at the optimal μQFR threshold. Corresponding Kaplan-Meier curves stratifying patients by µQFR < or ≥0.83 showed early divergence in cumulative incidence curves for VOCE and TLR, which persisted throughout follow-up (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 2). Due to several significant differences between the VOCE and non-VOCE groups, a propensity analysis was performed to isolate as much as possible the effect of µQFR. Propensity-score matching based on anatomical and clinical variables (Supplementary Table S2) successfully matched 29 lesions with low μQFR (<0.83) to 57 lesions with high μQFR (≥0.83). Post-matching covariate balance was moderately satisfactory (SMD <0.10 except for lesion location, reference vessel size lesion length and BMI where SMD was <0.2). Matched analyses revealed markedly higher risks associated with low μQFR for VOCE (HR, 6.01; 95% CI 2.48-14.46; p<0.0001) and TLR (HR, 12.64; 95% CI 3.66-43.59; p<0.001).

Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent μQFR-associated protection against VOCE regardless of vessel diameter: in vessels ≥ 2.5 mm (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–0.99, p=0.003) and in smaller vessels < 2.5 mm (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96–0.99, p=0.002). However, the predictive association was absent in bifurcation lesions (HR 1.01, p=0.63) but was  present in non-bifurcation lesions (HR 0.96, p<0.0001). Within a bifurcation, the µQFR had a better prognostic value in the main vessel (HR, 0.97; 95% CI 0.95-0.98; p<0.001) than in a branch (HR, 0.98; 95% CI 0.96-1.01; p=0.13).

Comparing μQFR with MLD measurements, MLD displayed superior ROC discrimination for VOCE (AUC 0.78; p = 0.048). In Cox regression, once adjusted for μQFR, residual MLD no longer contributed independently to predicting VOCE (p = 0.23). A likelihood-ratio test confirmed no incremental prognostic benefit from adding MLD to μQFR alone (χ² = 2.43, p = 0.12). A comprehensive multivariate Cox model incorporating several predictors including MLD further confirmed the independent prognostic value of μQFR: each 10-unit increase in μQFR was associated with a 29% reduction in VOCE (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57–0.89, p = 0.003). Emergent procedure emerged as the other strongest adverse factor (HR 4.79, 95% CI 1.83–12.57, p = 0.001). Other variables, including post-DCB MLD, were not independently predictive (Supplementary Table S3). The model demonstrated acceptable fit (global Schoenfeld p = 0.23) and moderate discrimination (c-index 0.68).

# DISCUSSION

This study demonstrated that a retrospective evaluation of angiography-derived 3D-μQFR measured immediately after DCB angioplasty is a strong prognostic marker for de novo coronary lesions: values < 0.83 were associated with higher VOCE and TLR, independent of anatomic or clinical covariates and to propensity matching. By demonstrating a consistent gradient of risk across the full μQFR spectrum in various vessel calibres, our study extends previous DCB data limited to ISR and provides the first 3D-µQFR comprehensive thresholds for native-vessel intervention. The key findings of our study are presented in Table 4.

The clinical relevance of post-procedural physiology is well established with wire-based FFR. Sub-optimal FFR after stenting predicts repeat revascularisation and death [@debruyneFractionalFlowReserve2012; @baranauskasFFRResultPost2016]. Angiography-derived indices such as QFR were developed to overcome the invasiveness and cost of pressure wires, and validated against invasive measurements [@fearonAccuracyFractionalFlow2019; @witbergDiagnosticPerformanceAngiogramDerived2020; @hwangDiagnosticAgreementQuantitative2019]. Low post-PCI QFR have been associated with two-year VOCE [@biscagliaPrognosticValueQFR2019], and FAVOR III China showed that QFR-guided PCI reduces MACE compared with angiography guidance alone [@xuAngiographicQuantitativeFlow2021]. Our findings parallel these trials, confirming that a wire-free approach can identify residual ischaemia even when no implant is left behind. The µQFR algorithm simplifies assessment by requiring two well-separated projections or, when unavoidable, a single optimal view. Its agreement with FFR and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) has been validated in complex disease subsets [@wuDiagnosticPerformanceAngiographyDerived2024; @bennarDiagnosticAccuracyAngiographyDerived2025; @dingQuantitativeFlowRatio2022]. Post-stenting μQFR values below 0.90, which could be computed in 97% of cases using a single angiographic view, were associated with higher rates of target-vessel failure at two years [@dingPrognosticValuePostpercutaneous2025]. The μQFR-guided virtual PCI strategy was superior to angiography-guided PCI in terms of physiological outcomes [@chenPrognosticValueMurray2024]. In our study, full 3D-μQFR was obtained with a second projection ≥ 25° in more than 85% of cases, avoiding the loss of anatomy with a single view. For the few mono view remaining, μQFR using a single angiographic projection can still be used as it showed excellent agreement with standard 3D-QFr [@cortesAgreementMurrayLawbased2022].

These wire-free methods facilitate routine physiological assessment, enabling improved identification of patients at higher risk for adverse outcomes. DCB angioplasty has been validated in small native vessels [@blumDrugCoatedBalloonsSmall2018; @corteseLongTermOutcomeDrugCoated2023] and ongoing large-scale RCTs, including SELUTION DE NOVO [@spauldingComparingStrategySirolimuseluting2023] and TRANSFORM II for small vessels [@grecoSirolimuscoatedBalloonEverolimuseluting2022], are further evaluating the role of DCBs in a all-comers de novo CAD population. Yet, even when angiographic results appear adequate, recurrence remains non-negligible, demonstrated with a high device-oriented composite endpoint in REC-CAGEFREE I [@gaoDrugcoatedBalloonAngioplasty2024]. Observational evidence already links higher FFR and iFR values 15 minutes after DCB to late lumen enlargement, suggesting favourable vessel remodelling and reduced residual ischemia [@yamamotoImpactPostPhysiological2022]. It was highlighted that a post-balloon angioplasty FFR ≥ 0.75 serves as a safe threshold for proceeding with DCB treatment reducing the need for bailout stenting implantation without compromising outcomes [@chungComparisonFractionalFlow2019]. A final QFR or μQFR below thresholds such as 0.86–0.94 after DCB for ISR independently predicts higher MACE or restenosis [@tangClinicalImplicationQuantitative2021; @liuPrognosticValuePostProcedural2023; @caiPrognosticValueQuantitative2021]. A similar study used µQFR in post-DCB PCI for ISR and found that μQFR ≤0.89 conferred a higher event risk at one year [@liuPrognosticValuePostProcedural2023]. In an observational study of 414 patients with de novo lesions treated by DCB-only, a post-PCI QFR ≥0.90 was associated with significantly lower 2-year MACE [@limImpactPostPercutaneousCoronary2025]. In the PICCOLETO II μQFR analysis, immediate post-procedural μQFR values were slightly lower after DCB angioplasty compared with DES, reflecting a less marked acute functional gain in the DCB arm [@fezziPhysiologicalPerformanceDrugCoated2025].
However, this initial difference did not persist at six months, μQFR was similar in both groups, supporting the hypothesis that DCBs can achieve durable vessel patency without leaving a permanent implant.
The upcoming PICCOLETO VI trial will provide complementary insights, comparing 227 patients treated with different DCB technologies [@piccoletoVI]. They pre-reported post-procedural μQFR values of 0.86-0.87, similar to our median μQFR of 0.86 in all patients. Their minimal late functional loss at 6 months supports the durability of physiological gains after DCB. 
However, to our knowledge, all aforementioned studies did not study µQFR with hard vessel oriented endpoint and establish prognostic thresholds, making our identification of μQFR as a predictor of adverse events a novel contribution. 
One last advantage of physiology for DCB is for long lesions with diffuse disease, for which achieving the target FFR ≥ 0.90 is often difficult with DES [@gomez-laraLongtermCoronaryFunctional2018]. 
DCBs are an avenue to explore for this type of lesion, with favorable retrospective data from hybrid PCI [@buonoProceduralOneyearOutcomes2024; @costopoulosRoleDrugelutingBalloons2013].

In our study, μQFR demonstrated consistent prognostic value across both small and large vessels. The prognostic gradient of μQFR was absent in bifurcation lesions, a finding concordant with technical work showing reduced μQFR accuracy where flow dynamics are complex or projections suboptimal [@leeInfluenceLesionDisease2021; @kanClinicalPrognosticValue2023]. Bifurcations require excellent imaging and even then small side branches or diffuse disease might yield less reliable QFR values [@tommasinoNovelQuantitativeFlow2023]. Dedicated bifurcation-specific algorithms or intra-procedural wire-based checks may therefore remain necessary in this setting.

## Limitations

Most available studies, including the present analysis, have assessed QFR or μQFR offline, without employing real-time physiological data to guide procedural strategy. Consequently, it remains uncertain whether µQFR-guided optimization during PCI confers incremental clinical benefit over standard angiography-guided approaches. Second, the reliability of QFR measurements can be compromised in the setting of major bifurcation lesions, severe coronary calcification, or suboptimal angiographic projections, potentially leading to misclassification of physiological severity. Third, the retrospective nature of this study, reliance on registry data, and lack of centralized core-lab adjudication introduce inherent risks of selection bias, residual confounding, and missing data. Fourth, this being a single-centre cohort and the inclusion of a range of DCB may contribute to heterogeneity in procedural technique and outcome, which can influence the generalizability and optimal thresholds of µQFR-based indices. Additionally, despite being based on an all-comers population, our study included a substantial proportion of small vessels, potentially limiting the generalizability of our μQFR threshold to larger vessel interventions where different physiological dynamics may apply. Finally, the absence of prospective, large-scale randomized trials specifically of physiology-guided DCB interventions in de novo coronary lesions precludes definitive causal inferences regarding the clinical impact of physiology-guided DCB strategies.

## Conclusion

In patients treated with DCB for de novo coronary disease, a post-procedural μQFR < 0.83 identified lesions at high risk of vessel-oriented events, chiefly driven by repeat revascularisation. Incorporating rapid, wire-free physiological assessment into DCB workflows may enable on-table optimisation and improve long-term durability of the "leave-nothing-behind" strategy.

| **Key finding** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **1. Prognostic threshold identified** | Post-procedural 3D-µQFR <0.83 independently predicts higher risk of vessel-oriented events (HR 6.01, 95% CI 2.48-14.46) after DCB in de novo coronary lesions |
| **2. Wire-free physiological assessment** | Angiography-based µQFR can be calculated immediately post-DCB using standard coronary angiograms |
| **3. Consistent across vessel sizes** | Prognostic value maintained in both small (<2.5mm) and large (≥2.5mm) vessels, supporting use across diverse anatomies (except bifurcations) |
| **4. Procedural optimization opportunity** | Real-time identification of suboptimal results (µQFR <0.83) can enable immediate optimization strategies before procedure completion, potentially improving long-term durability of DCB therapy |
