Drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty demonstrates the unique phenomenon of late lumen enlargement (LLE) whereby vessel dimensions increase over time without permanent scaffolding [@kleber2015]. While this anatomical finding is well-documented, the temporal evolution of coronary physiology after DCB treatment remains incompletely understood. Previous studies showed fractional flow reserve improves from baseline to post-procedure and remains stable at follow-up [@ann2016;@shin2016], but no study has demonstrated actual functional improvement from post-procedure to follow-up. We present the first evidence of late functional gain (LFG), defined as progressive physiological improvement after completion of the index procedure, in patients undergoing DCB angioplasty for de novo coronary disease.

This cohort study analyzed consecutive patients who underwent DCB treatment for de novo coronary lesions between January 2018 and December 2024 from the CARDIO-FR registry (NCT04185285). Inclusion criteria comprised patients aged ≥18 years with available baseline, post-procedural, and follow-up coronary angiography performed ≥7 days after the index procedure. Murray law-based quantitative flow ratio (μQFR) assessment was performed using AngioPlus Gallery (Pulse Medical Imaging Technology, Shanghai, China) by two independent blinded analysts. DCB procedures followed standard institutional protocols with lesion preparation at operator discretion. Balloon diameter was selected to achieve a balloon-to-vessel ratio between 1.0-1.25. LFG was defined as positive difference between follow-up and post-procedural μQFR. Statistical analyses employed paired t-tests for temporal comparisons and regression analyses for predictor identification.

Among 132 angiographies (66 de novo lesions in 59 patients; mean age 70.1±8.2 years, 22.0% female, 37.3% diabetic), lesion preparation included semi-compliant balloons (88.0%), non-compliant balloons (62.0%), cutting balloons (28.8%), and intravascular lithotripsy (5.1%). Sirolimus-coated balloons were used in 77.2% of procedures.

At median follow-up of 8.5 months, target lesion failure occurred in 14 lesions (21.2%). The primary finding was significant LFG: μQFR improved from 87.5±9.1% post-procedure to 89.8±7.0% at follow-up, representing mean change of 2.3% (95% CI 0.08-4.68; p=0.006). Thirty lesions (60.0%) demonstrated functional gain. After excluding target lesion failure, LFG was 3.5% (95% CI 1.46-6.15; p=0.002). LLE showed overall change of -0.04±0.50 mm (p=0.62), but when excluding target lesion failure, significant LLE of +0.10±0.30 mm was observed (95% CI 0.01-0.18; p=0.028).

Higher DCB diameter-to-vessel ratio and longer inflation time predicted functional improvement (+1.27%/0.1 ratio increase, p=0.015; +0.41%/second, p=0.011). The predilatation diameter-to-vessel ratio emerged as the strongest binary predictor (OR 17.23; p=0.006), followed by DCB diameter-to-vessel ratio (OR 14.38; p=0.011). Continuous optimization analysis identified optimal DCB-to-artery ratio of 1.31 (95% CI 1.03-1.45) for maximizing LFG. 
Lesion preparation characteristics other than diameter-to-vessel ratio, including specialty balloon type, showed no predictive value for functional improvement (all p>0.20). 
For LLE, only DCB inflation time predicted LLE (+0.011 mm/second; p=0.015).

This study provides first documentation of LFG after DCB angioplasty, revealing progressive coronary physiology improvement from post-procedure to follow-up. This finding advances our understanding of DCB biology, demonstrating vessel healing extends beyond the index procedure [@jeger2020]. Unlike drug-eluting stents where FFR deteriorates over time, or plain balloon angioplasty leading to functional decline, DCB achieves progressive physiological improvement through antiproliferative effects, positive vessel remodeling [@kleber2015], and endothelial function restoration.

Our findings identify two procedural determinants: adequate lesion preparation creating plaque disruption for drug penetration, and optimized DCB delivery through sufficient inflation time and appropriate sizing. Current guidelines recommend DCB sizing 0.9-1.3 balloon-to-vessel ratio [@fezziDefinitionsStandardizedEndpoints2025]; our results suggest targeting the upper range may enhance outcomes. The documentation of LFG establishes DCB as a restorative intervention achieving sustained biological vessel healing, particularly valuable where preserving physiological function is paramount.
